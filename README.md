# Teramon
Can you catch them all?

## Commands
* `pokego <playername>` Summons a player that has been added to your pokedex
* `pokecome` Despawns the player

## how it work?
* Whenever you see a player, it writes their data to a file, allowing you to spawn them later. By default the folder name is Teradex.
* This is the worst script ever written so please don't exect much.
